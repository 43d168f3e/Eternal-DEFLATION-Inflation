# Eternal-DEFLATION-Inflation
The (Split) Octonion algebra carries basic spinor representations of S = SO(4,4;R) (cover). We show (Mathematica notebook) that the Einstein-Lovelock vacuum field equations on a spacetime M8 (whose tangent bundle has S as iso group) possess a solution in which 3 of the 4 space dimensions superluminally INFLATE, 3 of the 4 time dimensions superluminally DEFLATE, and the 4th space dim curls up into a ring (hence a particle whose wave function is trapped in this ring acquires a mass contribution). We employ xAct "http://www.xact.es/download/xAct_1.2.0.tgz" to execute our calculations.
