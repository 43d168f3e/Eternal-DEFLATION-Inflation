# Eternal Superluminal Inflation and DEFLATION
We show (see scratch work Mathematica notebooks) that the Einstein-Lovelock vacuum field equations on an 8-dimensional spacetime M8
possess two special solutions, one with 1 time dimension and one with 4 time dimensions. For the latter case,
3 of the 4 space dimensions superluminally INFLATE, 3 of the 4 time dimensions superluminally DEFLATE, and the 4th space dim curls up into a ring (hence a particle whose wave function penetrates this ring acquires a mass contribution;  unsolved problem: keep the photon massless).

We employ xAct "http://www.xact.es/download/xAct_1.2.0.tgz" to execute our calculations.

Addendum:
I coupled Einstein gravity to the wave function of the Universe (Universes of mass +/- M).

Note that the Euler-Lagrange equations for the wave function of the Universe have (at least) 
2 partner solutions, with masses +M and -M; (compare with  electron/positron solutions of the Dirac equation).

-accordingly, I added a scratch work solution, "WaveFunctionUniverse-4+4-Einstein-Lovelock-Nash.nb", for  4 space dimensions and 4 time dims  [ordinary time coordinate = x4];

-previously added a very scratch work solution, "Einstein-Lovelock-7+1-Nash.nb", for 7 space dimensions and 1 time dim;
in which :
3 of the 7 space dimensions superluminally INFLATE forever,
3 of the 7 space dimensions superluminally DEFLATE forever,
and the 7th space dim [x0] curls up into a ring (hence a particle whose wave function is trapped in this ring acquires a mass contribution; same unsolved problem: keep the photon massless).
