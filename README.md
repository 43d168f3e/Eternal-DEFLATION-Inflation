# Eternal-DEFLATION-Inflation, with correction of typo in In[48]
The (Split) Octonion algebra carries basic spinor representations of S = SO(4,4;R) (cover). We show (Mathematica notebook) that the Einstein-Lovelock vacuum field equations on a spacetime M8 (whose tangent bundle has S as iso group) possess a solution in which 3 of the 4 space dimensions superluminally INFLATE, 3 of the 4 time dimensions superluminally DEFLATE, and the 4th space dim curls up into a ring (hence a particle whose wave function is trapped in this ring acquires a mass contribution). We employ xAct "http://www.xact.es/download/xAct_1.2.0.tgz" to execute our calculations.

Addendum:
-added a solution, "Einstein-Lovelock-Eternal-7+1,x7,x8.nb", for  7 space dimensions and 1 time dim [x8]; 
in which :
3 of the 7 space dimensions superluminally INFLATE forever,
3 of the 7 space dimensions superluminally DEFLATE forever,
and the 7th space dim [x7] curls up into a ring (hence a particle whose wave function is trapped in this ring acquires a mass contribution).

-also, "Einstein-Lovelock-Eternal-4+4.nb" is a slightly simplified solution of my original nb for the interesting case
in which 
3 of the 4 space dimensions superluminally INFLATE,
3 of the 4 time dimensions superluminally DEFLATE [while our beloved time coordinate, x4 (often called x0), is immune to this disturbance],
and the 4th space dim [x8] curls up into a ring (hence a particle whose wave function is trapped in this ring acquires a mass contribution).

Please forgive me for not editing the comments for these two new files completely; I did not think that it was necessary.

Please do not get too excited about these '-flation' effects. At each point in the universe the labeling of x4 vs x5 vs x6 vs x7 should be arbitary [the tangents to the 4 axes at 2 points in spacetime should be related by a Lorentz gauge rotation]; I have not introduced a gauge Lorentz-covariant, covariant derivative in this formalism. Maybe a younger person, or some AI, can do this.
