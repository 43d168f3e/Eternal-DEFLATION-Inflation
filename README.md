# Eternal Superluminal Inflation and DEFLATION
HYPOTHESIS:  If, according to  the  Einstein  (or Einstein-Lovelock) eqs. superluminal  inflation/deflation  exists,
             then    at  time x4 = 0 (before  the  particles  of  the  standard  model  exist) 
             a  pair  of  universes  with MASSES   \[PlusMinus] M  is created
             (i.e., universes  are  created in  pairs ).
             Note that dark matter/dark energy  may  be  related  to wave function overlap  of the two universes

We show (see scratch work Mathematica notebooks) that Universes may be/are created in pairs, with masses +M and -M, at the 'big bang.'

We also show (see scratch work Mathematica notebooks) that the Einstein-Lovelock vacuum field equations on an 8-dimensional spacetime M8
possess two special solutions, one with 1 time dimension and one with 4 time dimensions. For the latter case,
3 of the 4 space dimensions superluminally INFLATE, 3 of the 4 time dimensions superluminally DEFLATE, and the 4th space dim curls up into a ring (hence a particle whose wave function penetrates this ring acquires a mass contribution;  unsolved problem: keep the photon massless).

We employ xAct "http://www.xact.es/download/xAct_1.2.0.tgz" to execute our calculations.

Addendum:

I try to address the Question: Are Universe (s) of masses ± M created in pairs at time x4 = 0
(before the particles of the standard model exist) ?
Are dark matter/dark energy related to wave function overlap of these two universes?
Indications are that the Euler-Lagrange equations for the wave function of the Universe probably have (at least) 
2 partner solutions, with masses +M and -M; (compare with  electron/positron solutions of the Dirac equation; 
however, our scenario unfolds before  the  particles  of  the  standard  model  exist).

I coupled Einstein gravity to the wave function of the Universe (Universes of mass +/- M),
and have solved the Euler-Lagrange equations for the wave function of the universe(s).
Scratch work  solutions are computed/displayed in 
Pair-Crtn-Univ-same_E-L-eqs-alt-approach.nb.pdf,
Pair-Crtn-Univ-same_E-L-eqs-and-solutions.pdf and
Pair-Crtn-Univ-same_E-L-eqs-alt-approach.nb.
These contain lengthy Maple solutions/parameterizations of the solutions
of the Euler-Lagrange equations for the universe's wave function, in  4 space dimensions and 4 time dimensions.




I added 'ConvertMapleToMathematicaV2.wl,' which is a version-alpha parser I made to translate fromsolutions from maple to mathematica.


Also, I have added a very scratch work solution, "Einstein-Lovelock-7+1-Nash.nb", for 7 space dimensions and 1 time dim;
in which :
3 of the 7 space dimensions superluminally INFLATE forever,
3 of the 7 space dimensions superluminally DEFLATE forever,
and the 7th space dim [x0] curls up into a ring (hence a particle whose wave function is trapped in this ring acquires a mass contribution; same unsolved problem: keep the photon massless).
